Introduction </p><p>The Grevelingendam was built between 1958 and 1965 as a part of the Dutch Delta works (construction </p><p>in reaction on the major flooding disasters in 1953) and closed the Grevelingen from the Krammer- </p><p>Volkerak en so from the rivers upstream. It was part of the national water security strategy to shorten the </p><p>coastline of the Netherlands. Because of the realization of the Brouwerdam (1971) this water safety </p><p>function is not that manifest anymore. The Grevelingendam with its 6 kilometers long provides a road </p><p>connection between the island of Schouwen-Duiveland (Zeeland) and Goeree-Overflakkee (Zuid-Holland) </p><p>which nowadays has strong economic value for this region. From the moment of realization until now, the </p><p>dam more and more received recreational functions. At the Grevelingen side there is a windsurf hotpot </p><p>and the Eastern Scheldt side is a kitesurf spot and used as beach in the summer. To mitigate the </p><p>consequences of the Eastern Scheldt works (most expensive Delta work), in 1984 a sluice (siphon) in the </p><p>midst of the dam (Flakkeese Spuisluis) was realized in order to hold at level the salinity in the Eastern </p><p>Scheldt. From 1987 on, this sluice has no function anymore. In recent years, the sluice is discussed to be </p><p>reopened for water quality improvement of lake Grevelingen as well as a location of a tidal test center for </p><p>innovative energy production. </p><p>2. Tidal test center as pilot for large scale innovative energy production </p><p>Onwards from the creation of the Brouwersdam (1971), the water quality of the lake Grevelingen always </p><p>has been an issue of concern for governmental agencies (declining salinity, augmenting levels of </p><p>phosphate, lack of oxygen). To improve the salinity en keep the water salt, in 1978 the Brouwersluis was </p><p>constructed to make a new connection with the North Sea. However, this connection proved not to be </p><p>big enough to get a dynamic system in lake Grevelingen with oxygen exchange between the surface and </p><p>the deeper parts. This led to deterioration of the water quality of the lake which caused negative effects </p><p>for nature and economy (recreation and shellfish-fishery). Already in 2005, governmental explorations </p><p>concluded that re-using the Flakkeese Spuisluis could recover estuarine dynamics (in the east part) in the </p><p>lake Grevelingen. Together with topics on tourism, nature, recreation and spatial planning, energy </p><p>generation, the Flakeese Spuisluis is mentioned in the “Zicht op de Grevelingen” (2006) report. </p><p>In line with the thoughts on combining topics on energy and water quality at lake Grevelingen , several </p><p>local authorities (Nature and recreation authority Grevelingen) initiated (2007/2008) research on the </p><p>potential of using the Flakkeese Spuisluis for energy generation as well. On account of this report several </p><p>other public bodies (National water authority and province of Zeeland) followed this example. Most of </p><p>these examinations are on water quality (Nolte et al., 2008; Nolte en Spiteri, 2009; Nolte en Spiteri, 2010), </p><p>but the earlier mentioned additional topics became more prominent as well. None of them focus on the </p><p>Grevelingendam in particular, but in several occasions the dam is part of the study. Conclusions of these </p><p>examinations emphasize the feasibility of a culvert in the Brouwersdam combined with a profitable energy </p><p>plant (Vrijling, van Duijvendijk en Jonkman, 2008). These conclusions provided basis for further </p><p>development of plans and led to the installation of a commission on MIRT Grevelingen (2009). </p><p>The main focus of the MIRT commission was the improvement of water quality around lake Grevelingen. </p><p>The exploration of possibilities, strengthened by the involvement of municipalities and regional </p><p>authorities, had to lead to several applicable future scenarios in which feasibility and desirability were </p><p>preserved. From this moment on the Flakkeese Spuissluis each time was discussed in regional meetings </p><p>with the Secretary of State and later on with the minister of Infrastructure. In October 2013 the minister </p><p>decided to reopen the Flakkeese Spuisluis, unless the fact that private parties did not have a conclusive </p><p>business case. This decision triggered public and private organisations to think and work on multiple use </p><p>scenarios. </p><p>One of the partnerships that hitched on to this ‘multiple use’ purpose of the Grevelingendam was an </p><p>knowledge-alliance on the realisation of a Tidal Test Centre. In the shadow of the Brouwersdam, this test </p><p>facility had to be the first stage in the technical development of turbines. The expected costs of the </p><p>program of development were estimated at 1.3 million. The parties involved placed several requests for </p><p>subsidy to cover these costs. Half of the budget needed had to come from the INTERREG subsidy program </p><p>and for the other half the alliance reached out to public authorities. At this point, Nature and Recreation </p><p>authority tried to connect public and private actors and accelerated the process of development. Together </p><p>with mostly private actors they constructed a shared ambition in which organizational goals and ambitions </p><p>are combined. </p><p>After the Nature and Recreation authority was forced to not interfere in the project development </p><p>anymore (due to tender-rules), the Province Zeeland became the initiator of the Tidal Test Centre. The </p><p>Province South Holland would focus on the tidal energy plant in the Brouwersdam. The Province Zeeland </p><p>took the lead position and tried to trigger involvement of more market parties with success. The province </p><p>managed to bring them together, and several months later a new knowledge-alliance was born. Province </p><p>Zeeland entitled Antea Group as project leader whereupon the character of the initiative became more </p><p>privately loaded. The actors involved slightly differed from the former partners, but the goal of the joint </p><p>activity stayed the same. This new private initiation led to a Letter of Intent that was signed in February </p><p>2012. The focus of this LOI was for the major part on the realisation of a test facility in the Grevelingendam, </p><p>but for some of the partners some heartiness towards the tidal power plant in the Brouwersdam played </p><p>a role as well. In this phase of the project there were almost no public authorities involved any more. This </p><p>situation was in line with the thoughts of most private actors who wanted to keep the collaboration mainly </p><p>private. Up to this point in time they were convinced that initiative-costs could be easily covered without </p><p>additional financial resources of public authorities. Unfortunately, the parties involved were not able and </p><p>up to the investment asked for and some of them left the cooperation. Lack of financial resources and </p><p>uncertainties about frameworks and possibilities were the main triggers of these exits. </p><p>The second meeting on the realisation of the test facility, in December 2012, was dedicated to the topics </p><p>division of labour and contribution. At this moment still the lack of funding was an issue. This lack of </p><p>funding created a situation, in which both public and private parties adopted wait-and-see strategies. As </p><p>a result of this situation the process of development decelerated. But with the start of Pro-Tide, in January </p><p>2013, and the integration of both projects a kick-start was forced again. The realisation of the Tidal test </p><p>Centre was appropriate for inclusion in the Pro-Tide project since both projects tended to further </p><p>technology on tidal energy. This opportunity was grasped by Antea Group and together with Zeeland and </p><p>Zuid-Holland they developed a project outline. The main driver of this outline was the joint fabrication of </p><p>a business-case and an agreement on cooperation by private parties. </p><p>In March 2013 the first workshop on Pro-Tide took place. Some of the initial LOI partners were present, </p><p>but most of them were not involved any more. Especially the position of turbine developers was </p><p>represented well, and most of these parties were new to the collaboration. The main goal of the session </p><p>was to get clear insight on the goals and means of the joint activities. Which parties are in and which are </p><p>out, and what is the specific role of each party were topics discussed? Along with the clarification of these </p><p>topics the development of the tidal power plant at the Brouwersdam was discussed as well. New deadlines </p><p>were set for the decision on involvement. A project timeframe was formulated as well. </p><p>In the weeks after the meeting it became apparent for Antea Group and the provinces Zeeland and Zuid- </p><p>Holland that there was still little benevolence towards the development of the test facility. Despite the </p><p>fact that the necessary steps at this point in time had a highly technical focus, external initiative and </p><p>engagement on other subjects would have been welcomed with open arms. Antea Group worked on the </p><p>project plan during these weeks and finished it in April 2013. The first phase of the project plan described </p><p>research on engineering and construction for the test facility. The second phase comprised building </p><p>activities and exploitation. Activities in the first phase could be covered by funds acquired from INTERREG. </p><p>In these same months TTC NL enlisted for an OP-Zuid subsidy. The request encompassed an aggregate </p><p>amount of 300.000 euro. The request got rejected by the OP-Zuid commission, which led to a situation </p><p>where the funds needed for development were still missing (unless the fact that Province Zeeland </p><p>maintained its subsidy of 100.000 euros). </p><p>In the following months (from April on) the project-development showed no further progression. But </p><p>behind the scenes Antea Group was busy with the development of a Requirements Program. </p><p>Unfortunately full-time dedication was impossible. Lack of funds was still the main cause. Because of that, </p><p>it took Antea Group until December 2013 to deliver the Program of Requirements. During the months </p><p>that passed, Antea Group executed research on object conditions (Grevelingendam), licenses needed and </p><p>technical requirements for testing. These findings were based on conversations with several public and </p><p>private organisations in which ‘must haves’ were discussed. In November 2013, a large contribution to </p><p>the progress was made by the Ministry of Infrastructure and the Environment. The minister sanctioned </p><p>the commissioning of the Grevelingendam and allocated 5 million euros for this job. </p><p>The delivery of the Requirements Program led to a new task for Antea Group. On the basis of the earlier </p><p>mentioned findings, the organisation had to facilitate four more workshop on Pro-Tide. In the first months </p><p>of 2014 a ‘market consultation’ took place as well. During this consultation several market parties and </p><p>public authorities discussed the potential and profitability of a tidal power plant in the Brouwersdam. Due </p><p>to these events the enthusiasm regarding ‘tidal energy’ was triggered, through which actors became more </p><p>involved again. For the next four workshops the following topics were decided on: Cooperation and </p><p>Competition, Technics and Innovation, Negotiation and PPS and bundling and progression. </p><p>The second (first was in January 2013) workshop on Pro-Tide, on the 12th of February 2014, enjoyed lots </p><p>of attention. By using a mutual gains approach the parties involved tried to align their interests and </p><p>desires. This approach was necessary because the various new stakeholders brought in several new </p><p>perspectives. The workshop brought what had to bring and gave the facilitating parties some insight in </p><p>these new perspectives, goals and interests. </p><p>The subject of the third Pro-Tide workshop was determined before the beginning of the workshop-series. </p><p>According to this planning the subject should cover ‘technics and innovation’, but several days before the </p><p>workshop the facilitating parties (Antea Group and Zeeland) changed it. The facilitating parties noticed </p><p>that ‘financial resources’ was the number one topic discussed during the first two workshops. And since </p><p>realization was impossible without those resources they decided to focus primarily on this subject. REBEL </p><p>Group was instructed to design several different financial scenarios. Based on ‘rent’, ‘energy production’, </p><p>‘investments’ and ‘subsidies’ they developed several different compositions. Despite this effort, there was </p><p>still no final calculation by the end of the workshop. Opinions were still divided. The only shared conclusion </p><p>stated that external financial resources were crucial. The fourth and last workshop was organised on the </p><p>9th of April 2014. The discussion started where it ended in workshop number three, but this time a lot </p></div></section></div><section id="Footer3col" class="Section Section--components-2 Section--footer color-bg color-title z-30 p-1 ms-p-h-2vw  colors-dark colors-global " data-reactid="23"><div class="fx-1 bd-none ms-bd-r ms-bd-w-1" data-reactid="24"><div class="Group Group-heading ms-p-r-4" data-reactid="25"><div class="Site-title color-text-pop" data-reactid="26"><span data-reactid="27"><!-- react-empty: 28 --><h2 class="font-title" data-reactid="29"><a href="index.html" data-reactid="30"></a></h2></span></div></div></div><div class="fx-1" data-reactid="31"><div class="Group Group--links" data-reactid="32"><div class="Group Group--links f-s-m ms-f-s-s w-s-wrap ms-w-s-nowrap" data-reactid="33"></div></div></div></section></div></div>
