Integrating flood management and sustainable energy 

Lessons from five attempts to realize multifunctional Energy Dams 

Introducing the case Grevelingendam 

1\. Introduction 

The Grevelingendam was built between 1958 and 1965 as a part of the Dutch Delta works (construction 

in reaction on the major flooding disasters in 1953) and closed the Grevelingen from the Krammer- 

Volkerak en so from the rivers upstream. It was part of the national water security strategy to shorten the 

coastline of the Netherlands. Because of the realization of the Brouwerdam (1971) this water safety 

function is not that manifest anymore. The Grevelingendam with its 6 kilometers long provides a road 

connection between the island of Schouwen-Duiveland (Zeeland) and Goeree-Overflakkee (Zuid-Holland) 

which nowadays has strong economic value for this region. From the moment of realization until now, the 

dam more and more received recreational functions. At the Grevelingen side there is a windsurf hotpot 

and the Eastern Scheldt side is a kitesurf spot and used as beach in the summer. To mitigate the 

consequences of the Eastern Scheldt works (most expensive Delta work), in 1984 a sluice (siphon) in the 

midst of the dam (Flakkeese Spuisluis) was realized in order to hold at level the salinity in the Eastern 

Scheldt. From 1987 on, this sluice has no function anymore. In recent years, the sluice is discussed to be 

reopened for water quality improvement of lake Grevelingen as well as a location of a tidal test center for 

innovative energy production. 

2\. Tidal test center as pilot for large scale innovative energy production 

Onwards from the creation of the Brouwersdam (1971), the water quality of the lake Grevelingen always 

has been an issue of concern for governmental agencies (declining salinity, augmenting levels of 

phosphate, lack of oxygen). To improve the salinity en keep the water salt, in 1978 the Brouwersluis was 

constructed to make a new connection with the North Sea. However, this connection proved not to be 

big enough to get a dynamic system in lake Grevelingen with oxygen exchange between the surface and 

the deeper parts. This led to deterioration of the water quality of the lake which caused negative effects 

for nature and economy (recreation and shellfish-fishery). Already in 2005, governmental explorations 

concluded that re-using the Flakkeese Spuisluis could recover estuarine dynamics (in the east part) in the 

lake Grevelingen. Together with topics on tourism, nature, recreation and spatial planning, energy 

generation, the Flakeese Spuisluis is mentioned in the "Zicht op de Grevelingen" (2006) report. 

In line with the thoughts on combining topics on energy and water quality at lake Grevelingen , several 

local authorities (Nature and recreation authority Grevelingen) initiated (2007/2008) research on the 

potential of using the Flakkeese Spuisluis for energy generation as well. On account of this report several 

other public bodies (National water authority and province of Zeeland) followed this example. Most of 

these examinations are on water quality (Nolte et al., 2008; Nolte en Spiteri, 2009; Nolte en Spiteri, 2010), 

but the earlier mentioned additional topics became more prominent as well. None of them focus on the 

Grevelingendam in particular, but in several occasions the dam is part of the study. Conclusions of these 

examinations emphasize the feasibility of a culvert in the Brouwersdam combined with a profitable energy 

plant (Vrijling, van Duijvendijk en Jonkman, 2008). These conclusions provided basis for further 

development of plans and led to the installation of a commission on MIRT Grevelingen (2009). 

The main focus of the MIRT commission was the improvement of water quality around lake Grevelingen. 

The exploration of possibilities, strengthened by the involvement of municipalities and regional 

authorities, had to lead to several applicable future scenarios in which feasibility and desirability were 

preserved. From this moment on the Flakkeese Spuissluis each time was discussed in regional meetings 

with the Secretary of State and later on with the minister of Infrastructure. In October 2013 the minister 

decided to reopen the Flakkeese Spuisluis, unless the fact that private parties did not have a conclusive 

business case. This decision triggered public and private organisations to think and work on multiple use 

scenarios. 

One of the partnerships that hitched on to this 'multiple use' purpose of the Grevelingendam was an 

knowledge-alliance on the realisation of a Tidal Test Centre. In the shadow of the Brouwersdam, this test 

facility had to be the first stage in the technical development of turbines. The expected costs of the 

program of development were estimated at 1.3 million. The parties involved placed several requests for 

subsidy to cover these costs. Half of the budget needed had to come from the INTERREG subsidy program 

and for the other half the alliance reached out to public authorities. At this point, Nature and Recreation 

authority tried to connect public and private actors and accelerated the process of development. Together 

with mostly private actors they constructed a shared ambition in which organizational goals and ambitions 

are combined. 

After the Nature and Recreation authority was forced to not interfere in the project development 

anymore (due to tender-rules), the Province Zeeland became the initiator of the Tidal Test Centre. The 

Province South Holland would focus on the tidal energy plant in the Brouwersdam. The Province Zeeland 

took the lead position and tried to trigger involvement of more market parties with success. The province 

managed to bring them together, and several months later a new knowledge-alliance was born. Province 

Zeeland entitled Antea Group as project leader whereupon the character of the initiative became more 

privately loaded. The actors involved slightly differed from the former partners, but the goal of the joint 

activity stayed the same. This new private initiation led to a Letter of Intent that was signed in February 

2012\. The focus of this LOI was for the major part on the realisation of a test facility in the Grevelingendam, 

but for some of the partners some heartiness towards the tidal power plant in the Brouwersdam played 

a role as well. In this phase of the project there were almost no public authorities involved any more. This 

situation was in line with the thoughts of most private actors who wanted to keep the collaboration mainly 

private. Up to this point in time they were convinced that initiative-costs could be easily covered without 

additional financial resources of public authorities. Unfortunately, the parties involved were not able and 

up to the investment asked for and some of them left the cooperation. Lack of financial resources and 

uncertainties about frameworks and possibilities were the main triggers of these exits. 

The second meeting on the realisation of the test facility, in December 2012, was dedicated to the topics 

division of labour and contribution. At this moment still the lack of funding was an issue. This lack of 

funding created a situation, in which both public and private parties adopted wait-and-see strategies. As 

a result of this situation the process of development decelerated. But with the start of Pro-Tide, in January 

2013, and the integration of both projects a kick-start was forced again. The realisation of the Tidal test 

Centre was appropriate for inclusion in the Pro-Tide project since both projects tended to further 

technology on tidal energy. This opportunity was grasped by Antea Group and together with Zeeland and 

Zuid-Holland they developed a project outline. The main driver of this outline was the joint fabrication of 

a business-case and an agreement on cooperation by private parties. 

In March 2013 the first workshop on Pro-Tide took place. Some of the initial LOI partners were present, 

but most of them were not involved any more. Especially the position of turbine developers was 

represented well, and most of these parties were new to the collaboration. The main goal of the session 

was to get clear insight on the goals and means of the joint activities. Which parties are in and which are 

out, and what is the specific role of each party were topics discussed? Along with the clarification of these 

topics the development of the tidal power plant at the Brouwersdam was discussed as well. New deadlines 

were set for the decision on involvement. A project timeframe was formulated as well. 

In the weeks after the meeting it became apparent for Antea Group and the provinces Zeeland and Zuid- 

Holland that there was still little benevolence towards the development of the test facility. Despite the 

fact that the necessary steps at this point in time had a highly technical focus, external initiative and 

engagement on other subjects would have been welcomed with open arms. Antea Group worked on the 

project plan during these weeks and finished it in April 2013\. The first phase of the project plan described 

research on engineering and construction for the test facility. The second phase comprised building 

activities and exploitation. Activities in the first phase could be covered by funds acquired from INTERREG. 

In these same months TTC NL enlisted for an OP-Zuid subsidy. The request encompassed an aggregate 

amount of 300.000 euro. The request got rejected by the OP-Zuid commission, which led to a situation 

where the funds needed for development were still missing (unless the fact that Province Zeeland 

maintained its subsidy of 100.000 euros). 

In the following months (from April on) the project-development showed no further progression. But 

behind the scenes Antea Group was busy with the development of a Requirements Program. 

Unfortunately full-time dedication was impossible. Lack of funds was still the main cause. Because of that, 

it took Antea Group until December 2013 to deliver the Program of Requirements. During the months 

that passed, Antea Group executed research on object conditions (Grevelingendam), licenses needed and 

technical requirements for testing. These findings were based on conversations with several public and 

private organisations in which 'must haves' were discussed. In November 2013, a large contribution to 

the progress was made by the Ministry of Infrastructure and the Environment. The minister sanctioned 

the commissioning of the Grevelingendam and allocated 5 million euros for this job. 

The delivery of the Requirements Program led to a new task for Antea Group. On the basis of the earlier 

mentioned findings, the organisation had to facilitate four more workshop on Pro-Tide. In the first months 

of 2014 a 'market consultation' took place as well. During this consultation several market parties and 

public authorities discussed the potential and profitability of a tidal power plant in the Brouwersdam. Due 

to these events the enthusiasm regarding 'tidal energy' was triggered, through which actors became more 

involved again. For the next four workshops the following topics were decided on: Cooperation and 

Competition, Technics and Innovation, Negotiation and PPS and bundling and progression. 

The second (first was in January 2013) workshop on Pro-Tide, on the 12th of February 2014, enjoyed lots 

of attention. By using a mutual gains approach the parties involved tried to align their interests and 

desires. This approach was necessary because the various new stakeholders brought in several new 

perspectives. The workshop brought what had to bring and gave the facilitating parties some insight in 

these new perspectives, goals and interests. 

The subject of the third Pro-Tide workshop was determined before the beginning of the workshop-series. 

According to this planning the subject should cover 'technics and innovation', but several days before the 

workshop the facilitating parties (Antea Group and Zeeland) changed it. The facilitating parties noticed 

that 'financial resources' was the number one topic discussed during the first two workshops. And since 

realization was impossible without those resources they decided to focus primarily on this subject. REBEL 

Group was instructed to design several different financial scenarios. Based on 'rent', 'energy production', 

'investments' and 'subsidies' they developed several different compositions. Despite this effort, there was 

still no final calculation by the end of the workshop. Opinions were still divided. The only shared conclusion 

stated that external financial resources were crucial. The fourth and last workshop was organised on the 

9th of April 2014\. The discussion started where it ended in workshop number three, but this time a lot
